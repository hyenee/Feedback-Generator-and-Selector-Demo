    Lisa has a pet cat named Whiskers. Whiskers is black with a white spot on her chest. 
    Whiskers also has white paws that look like little white mittens.
    Whiskers likes to sleep in the sun on her favorite chair. 
    Whiskers also likes to drink creamy milk.
    Lisa is excited because on Saturday, Whiskers turns two years old.
    After school on Friday, Lisa rushes to the pet store. She wants to buy Whiskers' birthday presents. 
    Last year, she gave Whiskers a play mouse and a blue feather.
    For this birthday, Lisa is going to give Whiskers a red ball of yarn and a bowl with a picture of a cat on the side. 
    The picture is of a black cat. It looks a lot like Whiskers.
